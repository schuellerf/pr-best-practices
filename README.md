# GitHub Pull Request Checks and Actions Script

These Python scripts allow you to perform various checks and actions related to GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).
You can use them to ensure that your PRs adhere to certain standards and best practices before merging them into your codebase.

The simplest way to use this is by leveraging `action.yml` and integrate the scripts into your GitHub Actions workflow.

## Features

- **Check PR Title Contains Jira Ticket**: Verifies if the title of the pull request contains a Jira ticket reference.
- **Check Commits Contain Jira Ticket**: Scans the commits in the pull request to ensure each commit message contains a Jira ticket reference.
- **Check PR Description Is Not Empty**: Ensures that the pull request description is not empty.
- **Add 'best-practice' Label to PR**: Automatically adds the 'best-practice' label to the pull request on GitHub.
- **Creates a new Jira Ticket**: If the command `/jira-epic YOURJIRAKEY-1234` is detected in the **description** or a **comment** a Jira **Task** is created under the given Jira **Epic** "YOURJIRAKEY-1234"

## Integration in your GitHub project

create a file in `.github/workflows` e.g. `.github/workflows/pr_best_practices.yml`

```
name: "Verify PR best practices and check for `/jira-epic`"

on:
  pull_request_target:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  pr-best-practices:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PR best practice check
        uses: osbuild/pr-best-practices@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          jira_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
